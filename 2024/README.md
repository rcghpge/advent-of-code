# Advent of Code 2024 - Mojo Programming Language &#x1F525;
My submissions for Advent of Code 2024 in Mojo are not all 100%. This is my first attempt at learning the Mojo programming language developed by the Modular stack though it is still in development. If you happen to solve some of the puzzles please feel free to provide feedback and solutions. I want to thank the Modular community on Discord as well as the larger Python community. I utilized Python to cross-reference my solutions and logic (I know haha). Feel free to join the larger Modular community. If you are stumped on solutions, See the Python community on Discord for help with solutions. Spoiler: solutions are also provided.
