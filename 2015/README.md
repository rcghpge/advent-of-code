# Advent of Code 2015 - C Language

Welcome to the **Advent of Code 2015** directory in the C programming language! This repository provides solutions to the Advent of Code 2015 challenges, written in C with support for both **GCC** and **Clang** compilers. The project is designed for portability, robustness, and flexibility.

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Run the Setup Script

Run the setup script to initialize your environment:

```bash
./setup.sh
```

This script:
- Ensures **GCC**, **Clang**, **Make**, and other dependencies are installed.
- Configures your environment and sets up the **Advent of Code session cookie**.
- Creates necessary directories (`data/`, `build/`, `examples/`).
- Builds and installs all executables globally (e.g., `aoc`, `gcc2`, `clang2`, etc.).

### Step 2: Fetch Input Data

Pull input data for each day into the `data/` directory using the `aoc` command. For example:

```bash
aoc 1 2015       # Fetch input for Day 1 of 2015
aoc all 2015     # Fetch inputs for all days of 2015
```

This will store input files like `data/1.txt`, `data/2.txt`, etc.

---

## Building and Running

### Build the Project

To build all components (e.g., `aoc`, `gcc2`, `clang2`, examples):

```bash
make all
```

### Run Solutions

- Run a specific day's solution using GCC:

```bash
gcc2 1
```

- Run a specific day's solution using Clang:

```bash
clang2 1
```

- Run all solutions with both GCC and Clang:

```bash
main all
```

### Example Programs

Run example programs provided in the `examples/` directory:

```bash
example       # Run the libuv timer example
hello         # Run the Hello World example
```

### Clean Workflow Environment

To remove all build artifacts and reset the environment:

```bash
make clean
```

---

## Input Validation

The `Makefile` validates that input files are present in the `data/` directory. If input files are missing or incomplete, appropriate warnings or errors are displayed.

- Example error message if no input files are found:

```plaintext
Error: No input files found in data/.
```

- Example warning if some files are missing:

```plaintext
Warning: Input file data/2.txt is missing.
Input validation complete: Found 24 out of 25 files.
```

---

## Dependencies

This project depends on the following tools and libraries:

- **GCC (Custom version):** GNU Compiler Collection
- **Clang (Custom version):** LLVM Compiler
- **Make:** Build automation tool
- **libuv:** Cross-platform asynchronous I/O library
- **cURL:** Command-line tool for fetching input data

---

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Here’s how you can help:
- Provide feedback on improving the directory structure or code readability.
- Submit pull requests to optimize solutions or address issues.
- Add test cases to improve solution coverage and robustness.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **Executable Not Found:**
   - Ensure the `setup.sh` script completed without errors.
   - Verify that executables are in your `PATH` using `which <command>`.

2. **Input Data Missing:**
   - Use the `aoc` command to fetch input data for specific days.

3. **Compiler Conflicts:**
   - Ensure custom GCC (`gcc2`) and Clang (`clang2`) compilers are correctly configured.

For additional help, submit an issue or ask for support.
